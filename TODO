File: TODO - a top-level list

Project name: GiNaCRA - GiNaC Real Algebra package
Contact: Ulrich Loup <loup@cs.rwth-aachen.de>
Project sourceforge page: http://ginacra.sourceforge.net/
Development status: beta (testing + some features missing)

* General tasks concerning the package
 (1) ginacraconsole extension
 (2) Speedup by implementing reasonable basic:: methods.
 (3) Re-implement IntervalRepresentation using newer algorithm (current implementation slow!), e.g. following http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717103000932..

* Package extension
Implementation of the Janet algorithm for solving algebraic equation systems.

* Package extension
Quantifier elimination for the existential theory of the reals.

* Package extension
Exact Nonlinear Optimization using sign representations.

* Package extension
Besides interval and numeric representation of a real algebraic number, a representation by radicals with respective mixed-representation equality operators.
