Project name: GiNaCRA - GiNaC Real Algebra package
Contact: Ulrich Loup <loup@cs.rwth-aachen.de>
Project sourceforge page: http://ginacra.sourceforge.net/
Development status: beta (testing + some features missing)

* Prerequisites
    - The build system CMake (only for building from source): http://www.cmake.org/
    - The library CLN: http://www.ginac.de/CLN/
    - The library GiNaC: http://www.ginac.de/


* Optional dependencies
    - The test suite CppUnit: http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/
    - The console feature library Readline: http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/
    - The documentation build system Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ 


* How to build the project including library, tool src/tools/ginacraconsole and the test suites "src/tests/check_ginacra"

mkdir build         // Create a separate build directory.
cd build
cmake .             // Configure using cmake. Use "ccmake .." in order for an interactive user interface with more options.
make                // Build the project, in particular, build the library, the tests src/test/check_ginacra and the tools src/tools/ginacraconsole.


* How to run the tests

make check          // If necessary, builds src/test/check_ginacra in advance.


* Other targets to make

make help           // Show a list of possible targets including the below listed.
make clean          // Force the build system to re-build everything.
make install        // Install library to the specified (adjust via ccmake) system directory.
make package        // Construct a package of the project.
make uninstall      // Remove all installed files from the system.
make lib_ginacra    // Build the project library.
make check_ginacra  // Build the project test.
make examples       // Build some examples in the folder examples/.
make ginacraconsole // Build the project tool ginacraconsole.
make doc            // Build the project documentation (html + pdf, if pdflatex is available).
make package        // Build the binary package
make package_source // Build the source package (before, you should make clean)


* How to build the documentation

Required: Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

make doc


* Troubleshooting

  - If building the project via make fails, especially when linking with libginacra.so, one reason could be your -j setting. Try make -j1 instead.
    (This is of course only a workaround. We will fix the dependencies in CMakeLists.txt as soon we find out how.)

  - I have GiNaC installed but GiNaCRA does not find it!
      . Is pkg-config set up correctly? There must be a file named "ginac.pc" in the subfolder "pkgconfig/" of the library path to GiNaC's libraries.
      . Optional: Do LD_LIBRARY_PATH and /etc/ld.so.conf contain the path to the GiNaC libraries?
  
  This list can grow - by your help! Just contact one of the authors.
